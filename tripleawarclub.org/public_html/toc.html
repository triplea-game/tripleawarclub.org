<p><b>Match Rules:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>The tournament is single-elimination.</li>
<li>For each match, the choice of Axis-or-Allies will be determined by a
 bidding process, in which the player who bids the lowest takes Axis. 
The lower seeded player may begin the bidding process.</li>
<li>Games are to be played by e-mail, and players should complete at 
least one nation's turn a day. Each game must be completed within 3

<p>Players are seeded 1st-16th based on their <b>Overall Rank</b> in the
 table below.  The <b>Overall Rank</b> is the sum of each player's <b>Ladder
 Rank,</b> their relative position to each other in the standings, and 
their ladder <b>Win % Rank</b>, also relative.  Of the 16 entrants, only
 12 have been active on the ladder, and so they are seeded 1st-12th.  In
 a few cases, where the <b>Overall Rank</b> was a tie, the player with 
the higher <b>Ladder Rank</b> was seeded higher.  The four players 
without a ladder record were seeded alphabetically 13th-16th by the 
arbitration panel.</p>

<p>Kathrine (Axis +9) surrenders to allweneedislove (Allies) after 
russia's 4th turn</p>

<p>axis place bid in africa.</p>

<p>g1 purchase med fleet leave huge force in egypt, but can not stack 
karelia. uk abandons africa and annoys j, land in norway. j purchases 
trans instead of ic, makes 4 of a potential 8 attacks skipping out on 
sz52. becuase of g fleet positioning usa has to spend one round building
 up in the home waters and not advancing towards africa or europe.</p>

<p>russians 2nd turn take 3 european territories. g tries to take 3 back
 but sneaky russians moved aagun to karelia which hit g fig and kept 
karelia red. g does sweep africa and middle east. uk puts more into 
norway leaves picket in way of japan retaking borneo. j clears allied 
navy out of pacific, recaptures asian coastal territories. usa lands in 
africa.</p>

<p>3rd round rus trades 2 euro territories. g finishes claiming africa 
only leaving madagascar, reclaims euro territories except 2inf 1aagun 
garrisoned karelia as they were gun shy after losing 1/6 of luftwaffe in
 rd2. uk put more into norway. j finally pushes past orignal holdings in
 asia in all three routes. j also recaptures borneo and is poised to 
move warships through suez in rd4. usa liberates half of africa.</p>

<p>rd4 russia keeps trading. after rus turn allies are up 35units and 
150tuv. g still can not stack advance out of poland because russia could
 kill any advancing stack. even worse allies could stack karelia next 
round. africa was going to be liberated, but axis would have combined 
navy in med. j army was very small and slow.</p>

<p>axis could have held fortress europe forcing this game to have rounds
 into the teens but never put any pressure on russia. kathrine realized 
this would be a long slow economic loss for axis and graciously 
surrendered.</p>

<p>Thanks for katherine for another fun and well played game.<br>
allweneedislove.</p>

<div id="match3" class="details">
<p>Match 3 - Complete</p>
<p>Axis went for an Africa bid. Although some early pressure on Egypt 
the axis were able to get most of the japanese fleet in the 
mediterranean, this combined fleet was however directly taken out by the
 americans sacrificing most of their fleet, but still had a big TUV gain
 and africa was after this also a prey for the allies. The allies were 
also able to contain the allies well in europe and asia untill a well 
timed double move on ukraine and persia. The allies were forced to 
abandon caucasus but (again) helped by some good dice hit the axis hard 
in persia, killing all the remaining axis airforce. Germany was strong 
and in a good position though and put big pressure on russia. In R10 the
 germans however left an oppertunity for the allies to land in WE which 
subsequently forced the germans back and although the allies had to give
 WE up again the next turn the axis were hit hard in a double move on 
caucasus/ukraine after which they surrendered. </p>
</div>
<div id="match4" class="details">
<p>Match 4 - Complete</p>
<p>After placing art in Lib and arm in Alg, Germany was able to expand 
quickly in Africa. UK turned to the Pacific, taking 2 islands in their 
opening, forcing Japan to struggle early on. Germany stacked Kar for 2 
rounds, but Russian art and UK trans forced a pullback in G3. Japan 
eventually cleared the Pacific of UK threats, and started sweeping 
islands with trans and bomber, while Jap warships steamed toward the 
Med. USA had built up a strong fleet early, and was stationed off 
Gibraltar after USA3.</p>

<p>It took huge effort for Axis to hang onto Egypt long enough to allow 
the Jap fleet to enter the Med, but once there, USA was forced to pull 
back, giving G some breathing room. In the meantime, UK was flowing 
units into Eurasia via Nor and later Arch. Japs were building up units 
via 2 ICÃ¢â&#8218;¬â&#8222;¢s in FIC and India. The war was on!</p>

<p>In round 7, Germany was able to reclaim Kar, but that push allowed UK
 and USA to land everything in FranceÃ¢â&#8218;¬Â¦forcing G to pull back. The 
Nazis had just enough offensive threat to force Allies to evacuate, and 
that was the turning point in the war.</p>

<p>Germany had left a sizable stack in Kar, which Allies planned to 
double-tap. UKÃ¢â&#8218;¬â&#8222;¢s initial attack went bad, leaving them very 
damaged. USA could have mopped up the luftwaffe and remnant German 
ground forces, but the Jap air force flew to the rescue and defended 
Kar. The Allies never really recovered after that loss.</p>

<p>The buildup continued, but by now the Japanese, with 51 IPC 
production, were getting too large to contain. The USA fleet launched a 
devastating attack against the combined Axis Med fleet, leaving Axis 
ships and planes at the bottom of the sea. However, the loss of USA 
trans and air allowed Germany to surge forward one last time into Kar 
and Arch, followed by a Jap surge to Kaz. The impending double-tap on 
Moscow in round 11 was realized by Allied leadership, and they 
graciously surrendered, after an extremely well-fought war.</p>

<p>Match 7 - Complete</p>
<p>
Interesting game with a few non-standard strategies. Russia didn't take 
out Ukraine instead hitting Belo &amp; W Rus and so conserving units 
from the get-go. G1 loss of a fig to low odds dice against UK BB hurt, 
but 5 units in Egypt helped ease the pain. UK goes easy on the Japs and 
conserves units, grouping in SZ30. Some pretty average dice are rolled 
for the Axis in the next few rounds (including a couple of 1/27 chance 
scenarios) - frustrating &amp; delaying, but nothing game ending. Allies
 engage in SBR'ing to reduce Germanyâ&#8364;&#8482;s IPCs, until R4 when UK bomber 
and then 1 of 2 US bombers is lost. R5 and a miscalculation leaves a 
large portion of the Russian army exposed, leading the Germans to attack
 and Russia to suffer a somewhat mortal blow. Allies surrender on UK5. 
Thanks for a good game Andy :)</p>

<p>epinikion (axis-bid9) defeats trooper (allies) by surrender after uk7. Japan was going to enter mos.
it was an exiting game with several big figths. allies started great with uk1 in pacific. Japan left out pearl.
but was growing step by step every round. germ started great with kar stack and 3 units in egy, was growing fast and held the income solid around 44-50 ipc from round 2 until the end.
uk stacked in norway supported by usa (round 3). Ger attacked successfully russian stack in wr in round 5 and uk/usa stack in kar in round 6. japan med fleet loosed a big figth against us-fleet.
dices were far from likely during the game -similar the referees in soccer world champion chip- so the game went down for a wire.</p>

<p>bayder (Allies) advances over allweneedislove (Axis +9) by withdrawal after UK7

<p>Unfortunately, AWNIL has not been able to play in over 2 weeks, and will remain busy for the foreseeable future. So, he offered a "draw" but with agreement to have me advance in the ToC IV since he will not have time. I told him I'd rather play it out, but understand his situation, and he confirmed he couldn't continue playing at this time.</p>

<p>The game truly was what I'd consider a draw. Moscow was going to fall to the Japanese in J7, and Berlin was going to fall to UK in UK8. Japan had mopped up the Pacific islands, but Allies had all of Africa and the Med in control. It would have made for an epic ending as Japs started landing in Africa and producing in Moscow...with Allies producing in Berlin and SE</p>

<p>Anyway, it was a fun and well-played game by AWNIL...and his sportsmanship is always top shelf. I'll look forward to playing baxter in the semi-finals!</p>

<p>Bung (Allies) surrenders to Baxter (Axis +9) after Germany's 2nd turn.</p>

<p>Axis place bid in Africa, 1 to Japan</p>

<p>Round 1 and Russia takes the usual battles in Ukraine and W Rus. With a bit of luck Russia keeps 7 inf in W Rus, which combined with it's 3 tank buy, means Germany can't stack Karelia. Nothing special on G1, but 4 units left in Egypt are enough for the Allies to take the risk of clearing it. With a bit of luck the Allies keep both fighter and bomber, landing them in Belgium Congo. The UK is also successful in taking New Guinea. The rest of the UK turn though is dismal, with the UK sub losing to the Jap sub, the Jap trans destroying the UK dest, and finally losing a fighter while taking out the G inf in Karelia. Japan's turn, and with all units available, is able to put in a strong performance, taking out Pearl, India, China, Bury and killing both UK trans. US have no combat moves. R2 and battles are fought and won in India, Ukraine and Belo, with a tank run through to Norway, turning the countryside red. G2 and they all turn grey again, but more importantly, Germany gets lucky in Belgium Congo and knocks out both the UK bomber and fighter with a '1' on the dice, leaving the UK with an airforce consisting of just 1 fighter (with no aircraft purchased on UK1). At this point I don't think the game is over, but Bung cites a lack of time in the coming weeks, and bows out. So a short game all up.</p>

<p>Epi resigned after R15UK after a very hard fought battle.</p>

<p>Early advantage was for the allies with some vgood moves including taking the german fleet in the med out and putting early pressure on germany. The Japs came on very strong though and the game started to turn a bit after the Japs were able to stack persia as well as novo. The game started to favour the axis after the japs killed an usa trannie with the bomber, thereby forcing the allies to break off a WE stack. Germany could after this secure europe and the japs kept on building pressure on russia. Although Epi launched a nice asia offensive and created a second front for the japs in the atlantic the allies finally surrendered in R15.</p>

<p>Thanks Epi for another great game!</p>

<p>Bayder (Axis +9) surrenders to Baxter (Allies) after G6</p>

<p>Axis bid to Japan, 1 trans in sz 50</p>

<p>It was a fast paced exciting game, with some spectacular moves, and a couple of heavy sea battles. I also had the luck in the early rounds which certainly helped consolidate Russiaâ€™s position against fierce pressure from the Japanese.</p>

<p>R1 and the Russians luckily kept 7 inf in WR which along with a 4 tank buy kept Germany from stacking Karelia. Without a bid, the Germans took Egypt with 2 units surviving. The UK went high on UK1 to immediately start the assistance to Russia by taking Karelia and Norway, and so didnâ€™t drop troops to Africa, but was able to reclaim Egypt. The Jap transport bid meant that Jap units hit the mainland hard, right from J1 and started to turn Eurasia yellow. G2 and Bayder had the first of 2 very low odds losses in Karelia, the 2nd of which on G3 allowed a temporary Allied stack. But it was an inspired move on G2 to hold WE with all the Luftwaffe, which called for a major decision - keep the US momentum through Africa and possibly sacrifice the US fleet (2 dest, 5 trans), or hold back a round. I decided to go the sacrifice route and put them in position in SZ 12 and on G3 Bayder took the battle with a +34TUV result (keeping one fig above expected, but which made up for a fig Iâ€™d been fortunate to keep in a US2 battle). With the benefit of hindsight, this might not have been the best move, as probably waiting that one extra round might have paid a higher overall dividend - it effectively left the US unable to do much more for the rest of the game than just drop troops to Africa - but at least the Germans were down 3 figs too and the US had troops in Africa. On with the game though, and it progressed with tit for tat battles for the next couple of rounds, leaving me just over 3 Â½ units above expected net hits by the end of J5 â€“ a considerable help.</p>

<p>At this stage the Japs had a stack in Persia, the Germans had a stack in Karelia, and the Jap fleet had entered the Med. The Allies though had maintained their outproduction of the Axis by 20-25 IPC per round and Russia was growing strong. US5/R6 was a lucky turn with a clean round of battles, and the net hits in my favour jumped above 6, much to Bayderâ€™s frustration. And so at the start of G6 with the Allies up 162IPCâ€™s and 48 units on the Axis, Bayder decided to take a battle in sz5 which may have swung the game back into his favour, if successful - 3 fig 1 bom vs UK BB & 4 trans. Thankfully I scored a hit on a 2 on the first round, meaning the battle was effectively over, and Bayder surrendered the game.</p>

<p>This was the first time weâ€™d played against each other and it's clear to me that I still have plenty to learn. So thanks to Bayder for a powerful game, one in which I certainly had the luck, and I appreciate the in-depth analysis we had following it. </p>

<p>Match 15 - Complete!</p>
<p>It was a very very hard fought battle which Baxter deserved to win at least as much as me i think, but there had to be a winner and the dice decided it was me.</p>

<p>a very brief summary: a unsuccesful uk attack vs german fleet left trannie and destroyer which germany managed to slip into the med... this defined the game with the axis holding most of africa until round 14-15(!)
This made germany on one hand very rich, but the focus on africa also reduced pressure on russia and from round 9 the allies started to put serious pressure on germany holding eastern europe. germany was able to hold western though... because of germany building up more and more troops and with an ever increasing pressure from the japs from the east the allies had to abandon eastern again giving the germans space to march east. in the last round(s) of the game the japs could finally stack kazakh. The russians were able to take out the german ukraine stack though, the dice went against the russians however giving the germans a counter attack which succeeded leaving the russians now with only a small stack in russia. a uk (one land unit) attempt to take ukraine back failed because the single german tanks hits thus leaving aa's between usa fighters in russia and the jap/german fleet making it relatively safe or at least very expensive to attack. With germany still holding on to we and caucasus now open for the japs and russia barely being able to hold russia baxter resigns...</p>

<p>thanks for the great game baxter, it could just as well have gone your way! and uk1 and particularly some battles in the later stages of the game the dice fell my way, which had they gone the other way the game could easily have gone to the allies...</p>
